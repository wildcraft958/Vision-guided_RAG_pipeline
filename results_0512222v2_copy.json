      "content": "A toolbox for lattice spin models with polar molecules\n\nA. Micheli,∗ G. K. Brennen, and P. Zoller\n\nInstitute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, and Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Science, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria\n\n(Dated: October 2, 2018)\n\nThere is growing interest to investigate states of matter with topological order, which support excitations in the form of anyons, and which underly topological quantum computing. Examples of such systems include lattice spin models in two dimensions. Here we show that relevant Hamiltonians can be systematically engineered with polar molecules stored in optical lattices, where the spin is represented by a single electron outside a closed shell of a heteronuclear molecule in its rotational ground state. Combining microwave excitation with the dipole‑dipole interactions and spin‑rotation couplings allows us to build a complete toolbox for effective two‑spin interactions with designable range and spatial anisotropy, and with coupling strengths signiﬁcantly larger than relevant decoherence rates. As an illustration we discuss two models: a 2D square lattice with an energy gap providing for protected quantum memory, and another on stacked triangular lattices leading to topological quantum computing.\n\nLattice spin models are ubiquitous in condensed matter physics where they are used as simpliﬁed models to describe the characteristic behavior of more complicated interacting physical systems. Recently there have been exciting theoretical discoveries of models with quasi‑local spin interactions with emergent topological order [1, 2]. In contrast to Landau theory where various phases of matter are described by broken symmetries, topological ordered states are distinguished by homology class and have the property of being robust to arbitrary perturbations of the underlying Hamiltonian. These states do not exhibit long range order in pairwise operators, rather they have long range order in highly nonlocal strings of operators. A real world example is the fractional quantum Hall effect which gives rise to states with the same symmetry but distinguishable by quantum numbers associated with the topology of the surface they live on [3].\n\nIt is of signiﬁcant interest to “design” materials with these properties, both to observe and study exotic phases, and in light of possible applications. Cold atomic and molecular gases in optical lattices are prime candidates for this endeavor in view of the complete controllability of these systems in the laboratory. The idea of realizing bosonic and fermionic Hubbard models, and thus also lattice spin models, with cold atoms in optical lattices has sparked a remarkable series of experiments, and has triggered numerous theoretical studies to develop cold atoms as a quantum simulator for strongly correlated condensed matter systems (see e.g. [4, 5, 6] and references therein). However, coaxing a physical system to mimic the required interactions for relevant lattice spin models, which must be both anisotropic in space and in the spin degrees of freedom, and given range, is highly nontrivial. Here we show that cold gases of polar molecules, as presently developed in the laboratory [7], allow us to construct in a natural way a complete toolbox for any permutation symmetric two spin‑1/2 (qubit) interaction. The attractiveness of this idea also rests on the fact that dipolar interactions have coupling strengths signiﬁcantly larger than those of the atomic Hubbard models, and relevant decoherence rates.",

      "content": "Two highly anisotropic models with spin‑1/2 particles which we will show how to simulate are illustrated in Figs. 1a and 1b respectively. The ﬁrst takes place on a square 2D lattice with nearest neighbor interactions\n\n(I) ℓ−1ℓ−1\n\nH = ∑ ∑ J(σz σz + cos ζσx σx ).\n\nspin i=1 j=1 i, j i, j+1 i, j i+1, j\n\nIntroduced by Duoc¸ot et al. [8] in the context of Josephson junction arrays, this model (for ζ = ±π/2) admits a 2‑ fold degenerate ground subspace that is immune to local noise up to ℓth order and hence is a good candidate for storing a protected qubit.\n\nThe second, occurs on a bipartite lattice constructed with two 2D triangular lattices, one shifted and stacked on top of the other. The interactions are indicated by nearest neighbor\n\nOur system is comprised of heteronuclear molecules with 2Σ1/2 ground electronic states, corresponding for example to alkaline-earth monohalogenides with a single electron outside a closed shell. We adopt a model molecule where the rotational excitations are described by the Hamiltonian Hm = BN2 + γN · S with N the dimensionless orbital angular momentum of the nuclei, and S the dimensionless electronic spin (assumed to be S = 1/2 in the following). Here B denotes the rotational constant and γ is the spin-rotation coupling constant, where a typical B is a few tens of GHz, and γ in the model is very small.\n\nTherefore, we propose dynamical mixing with dipole-dipole coupled excited states using a microwave field.\n\nIn order to induce strong dipole-dipole coupling we introduce a microwave field E(x,t)ei(ωt) with a frequency ω tuned near resonance with the N = FF transition. Be-spaced nonlinearly, this transition is resolvable without coupling to higher rotational states by multiphoton processes. In the rotating wave approximation, the molecule-field interaction is Hmf = -1/2(h†·Eiei(k·x - ωt)/2 + h.c.), where the Rabi frequency is |Ω| = |E0|/h¯. As the molecules are trapped by optical wavelengths such that kF∆z ∼ 10-5 the dipoles are excited in phase only. The effective Hamiltonian acting on the ground states is obtained in second order perturbation theory as \n\nHeff(r) = ∑∑〈gf|Hmf|λ(r)〉〈λ(r)|Hmf|gi〉h|gf〉〈gi|, (4)\n\nThe reduced interaction in the subspace of the spin degrees of freedom is then obtained by tracing over the motional degrees of freedom. For molecules trapped in the ground motional states of isotropic harmonic wells with rms width z0 the wave function is separable in center of mass and relative coordinates with the relative coordinate wavefunction \n\nψrel(r,θ) = 1/π3/4(2z0)3/2e-(r2 + ∆z2 - 2r∆zcosθ)/8z2\n\nwhere cos θ = r · z then Hspin = 〈Heff(r)〉rel.\n\nThe Hamiltonian in Eq. (4) is guaranteed to yield some entangling interaction for appropriate choice of field parameters but it is desirable to have a systematic way to design a spin-spin interaction. Fortunately, the model presented here possesses sufficient structure to achieve this essentially analytically. The effective Hamiltonian on molecules 1 and 2 induced by a microwave field is \n\nHeff(r) = h|Ω| ∑α,β=03 σαAα,β(r)σβ, (5)\n\nwhere {σα}3 ≡ {1,σx,σy,σz} and Aα is a real symmetric tensor.

      "content": "Near the bare resonance h¯ωF − 2B = γ/2 the system shows multiple long‑range resonances as all the sites couple near‑resonantly at coupling strength ∝ 1/b3. The last of these long‑range resonance appears at h¯ωF − 2B ≈ 1.36γ for the interaction between next nearest neighbor sites with spacings of √2b. The 2‑resonance lies at h¯ωF − 2B ≈ 1.9γ for nearest neighbor sites and shows the remarkable feature of no magnetization on any site in any space‑direction α within the ground‑state manifold (see inset). The resulting immunity of the system to local noise can be probed by applying a homogeneous B‑field of frequency ωprobe polarized in the direction α = x,y,z.\n\nThe corresponding absorption spectrum for an arbitrary code state |ψ〉L is,\n\nχα(ωprobe) ≡ −hαΓℑ[〈ψ|Sα(h¯ωprobe − HL + ih¯Γ)Sα|ψ〉L]\n\nwhere Sα = ∑i j σα /ℓ2 and Γ is an effective linewidth. This quantity is obtained plotted in Fig. 3(b) for two different spin‑textures for the same field frequency ωF = 1.88γ but different polarizations and where we set Γ = 0.1J. For polarization ζ = 0 (see top inset) one realizes the protected qubit, whose spectrum is gapped by J/2. For polarization along the x^‑direction ζ = π/2 (see bottom inset) the ground‑subspace is given by a set of ℓ quantum‑Ising stripes along z, whose spectrum is ungapped with a large peak at ωprobe = 0 in response to coupling with a B field polarized along α = x.\n\nFor nearest neighbor couplings, the edge width indicates the relative strength of the absolute value of the coupling. For this implementation, the nearest neighbor separation is b = rγ. Three fields all polarized along z were used to generate the effective spin‑spin interaction with frequencies and intensities optimized to approximate the ideal model H (II). The field detunings at the nearest neighbor spacing are:\n\n| h¯ω − E(1 (1/2)) | = −0.05γ/2 |\n| ------------------ | ---------- |\n| h¯ω2 − E(0g (1/2)) | = 0.05γ/2 |\n| h¯ω3 − E(2g (3/2)) | = 0.10γ/2 |\n\nand the amplitudes are |Ω1| = |Ω2| = 0.01γ/h¯. For γ = 40MHz this generates effective coupling strengths Jz = −100kHz and J⊥ = −0.4Jz. The magnitude of residual nearest neighbor couplings are less than 0.04|Jz| along x and y‑links and less than 0.003|Jz| along z‑links. The size of longer range couplings Jlr are indicated by edge line style (dashed: |Jlr| < 0.01|Jz|, dotted: |Jlr| < 10−3|Jz|).\n\nSpin model II is likewise obtained using this mechanism. Consider a system of four molecules connected by three length b edges forming an orthogonal triad in space. There are several different microwave field configurations that can be used to realize the interaction H(II) along the links. One choice is to use two microwave spin fields polarized along z, one tuned near resonance with a 1g potential and one near a 1u potential. When the detunings and Rabi frequencies are chosen so that 〈|Ω1g|C(1g,3,3) − |Ω1u|C(1u,1,1)〉rel = 0 then the resultant spin pattern is Eq. (2) with J⊥ = −h¯〈|Ω1g|C(1g,3,3)〉rel/4 and Jz = h¯|〈|Ω1g|C(1g,2,2)〉rel/4.",
