[HEAD]Data Communication (IE30006) > Mid-Semester examination (Spring, 2016-2017) > Q1. Signal Approximation[/HEAD]
Q1. (a) Consider the problem of approximating a real signal g(t) in terms of another real
signal x(t) over an interval [t1, t2]:
g(t) = cx(t)
t1 ≤ t ≤t2
Derive the expression for the optimum value of c for best approximation of g(t) with x(t).
(3 marks)
(b) For the square signal g(t) shown in the Figure below, approximate g(t) in terms of
sin(t) so that the energy of the error signal is the minimum.

The image shows a graph titled "g(t)" depicting a square wave. The x-axis ranges from approximately -4π to 4π, marked with -4π, -3π, -2π, -π, 0, π, 2π, 3π, 4π. The y-axis is marked with -1 and 1. The square wave alternates between 1 and -1, with a period of 2π. Specifically, it is 1 for intervals like (0, π), (2π, 3π), (-2π, -π), and -1 for intervals like (π, 2π), (3π, 4π), (-π, 0), (-3π, -2π). Overlaid on this is a dashed sinusoidal wave, labeled "sin(t)", which appears to be a sine wave with amplitude 1.

Q3. (a) Estimate essential bandwidth W in rad/s of the signal e-atu(t) if the essential band is
required to contain 95% of the signal energy.

The image shows a random binary pulse train labeled "g(t)". The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents amplitude. The pulse width is denoted as Tb/2. The signal consists of rectangular pulses, some positive (amplitude 1) and some negative (amplitude -1). Each pulse has a duration of Tb/2, and there is a time interval of Tb between the start of consecutive pulses. For instance, a positive pulse is shown from 0 to Tb/2, followed by a negative pulse from Tb to Tb + Tb/2, then another positive pulse from 2Tb to 2Tb + Tb/2, and so on.

(b) The figure above shows a random binary pulse train g(t). The pulse width is T/2 and
one binary digit is transmitted every T seconds. A binary 1 is transmitted by the positive pulse
and a binary 0 is transmitted by the negative pulse. The two symbols are equally likely and
occur randomly. Determine the auto-correlation function. (Assume that N pulses occur in the
averaging interval T.)
