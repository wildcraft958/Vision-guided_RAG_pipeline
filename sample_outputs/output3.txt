[HEAD]A toolbox for lattice spin models with polar molecules > Abstract[/HEAD]
There is growing interest to investigate states of matter with topological order, which support excitations in the
form of anyons, and which underly topological quantum computing. Examples of such systems include lattice
spin models in two dimensions. Here we show that relevant Hamiltonians can be systematically engineered
with polar molecules stored in optical lattices, where the spin is represented by a single electron outside a closed
shell of a heteronuclear molecule in its rotational ground state. Combining microwave excitation with the
dipole-dipole interactions and spin-rotation couplings allows us to build a complete toolbox for effective two-
spin interactions with designable range and spatial anisotropy, and with coupling strengths significantly larger
than relevant decoherence rates. As an illustration we discuss two models: a 2D square lattice with an energy
gap providing for protected quantum memory, and another on stacked triangular lattices leading to topological
quantum computing.

[HEAD]A toolbox for lattice spin models with polar molecules > I. INTRODUCTION[/HEAD]
Lattice spin models are ubiquitous in condensed matter
physics where they are used as simplified models to describe
the characteristic behavior of more complicated interacting
physical systems. Recently there have been exciting theoret-
ical discoveries of models with quasi-local spin interactions
with emergent topological order [1, 2]. In contrast to Landau
theory where various phases of matter are described by bro-
ken symmetries, topological ordered states are distinguished
by homology class and have the property of being robust to
arbitrary perturbations of the underlying Hamiltonian. These
states do not exhibit long range order in pairwise operators,
rather they have long range order in highly nonlocal strings
of operators. A real world example is the fractional quantum
Hall effect which gives rise to states with the same symmetry
but distinguishable by quantum numbers associated with the
topology of the surface they live on [3].

It is of significant interest to “design” materials with these
properties, both to observe and study exotic phases, and in
light of possible applications. Cold atomic and molecular
gases in optical lattices are prime candidates for this endeavor
in view of the complete controllability of these systems in
the laboratory. The idea of realizing bosonic and fermionic
Hubbard models, and thus also lattice spin models, with cold
atoms in optical lattices has sparked a remarkable series of
experiments, and has triggered numerous theoretical studies
to develop cold atoms as a quantum simulator for strongly
correlated condensed matter systems (see e.g. [4, 5, 6] and
references therein). However, coaxing a physical system to
mimic the required interactions for relevant lattice spin mod-
els, which must be both anisotropic in space and in the spin de-
grees of freedom, and given range, is highly nontrivial. Here
we show that cold gases of polar molecules, as presently de-
veloped in the laboratory [7], allow us to construct in a natural
way a complete toolbox for any permutation symmetric two
spin-1/2 (qubit) interaction. The attractiveness of this idea

also rests on the fact that dipolar interactions have coupling
strengths significantly larger than those of the atomic Hubbard
models, and relevant decoherence rates.
Our basic building block is a system of two polar molecules
strongly trapped a given sites of an optical lattice, where the
spin-1/2 (or qubit) is represented by a single electron out-
side a closed shell of a heteronuclear molecule in its rotational
ground state. Heteronuclear molecules have large permanent
electric dipole moments. This implies that the rotational mo-
tion of molecules is coupled strongly via the dipole-dipole in-
teractions, whose signatures are the long range 1/r³ character
and an angular dependence, where the polar molecules attract
or repel each other depending on the relative orientation of
their dipole moments. In addition, microwave excitation of
rotational energy levels allows to effectively tailor the spatial
dependence of dipole-dipole interactions. Finally, account-
ing for the spin-rotation splitting of molecular rotational levels
we can make these dipole-dipole interactions spin-dependent.
General lattice spin models are readily built from these binary
interactions.

This model has the same spin dependence and nearest neigh-

Kitaev [9]. He has shown that by tuning the ratio of interac-
tion strengths |J₁|/|Jz| one can tune the system from a gapped
phase carrying Abelian anyonic excitations to a gapless phase
which in the presence of a magnetic field becomes gapped
with non-Abelian excitations. In the regime |J₁|/|Jz| < 1 the
Hamilonian can be mapped to a model with four body oper-
ators on a square lattice with ground states that encode topo-
logically protected quantum memory [10]. One proposal [11]
describes how to use trapped atoms in spin dependent optical
lattices to simulate the spin model H(II). There the induced
spin couplings are obtained via spin dependent collisions in
second order tunneling processes. Larger coupling strengths
are desirable. In both spin models (I and II) above, the signs
of the interactions are irrelevant although we will be able to

While we ignore hyperfine interactions in the present work,
our discussion below is readily extended to include hyperfine
effects, which offer extensions to spin systems S > 1/2.
The Hamiltonian describing the internal and external dy-
namics of a pair of molecules trapped in wells of an optical
lattice is denoted by H = Hin+Hex. The interaction describing
the internal degrees of freedom is Hin = Hdd + Σ²=1 Him. Here
Hdd is the dipole-dipole interaction given below in Eq. (3).
The Hamiltonian describing the external, or motional, degrees
of freedom is Hex = Σ²=1P}/(2m) + Vi(x; − xì), where P; is
the momentum of molecule i with mass m, and the potential
generated by the optical lattice V₁(x – x₁) describes an exter-
nal confinement of molecule i about a local minimum x₁ with
1D rms width zo. We assume isotropic traps that are approx-
imately harmonic near the trap minimum with a vibrational
spacing hoosc. Furthermore, we assume that the molecules
can be prepared in the motional ground state of each local
potential using dissipative electromagnetic pumping [12]. It
is convenient to define the quantization axis ĉ along the axis
connecting the two molecules, x2 – X₁ = Azź with Az corre-
sponding to a multiple of the lattice spacing.

The dipole operator coupling the ground and first rotational

and d is the dimensionful dipole moment.
While the present situation of dipole-dipole coupling of ro-
tationally excited polar molecules is reminiscent of the dipole-
dipole interaction of between electronically excited atom pairs
[13], there are important differences. First, unlike the atomic
case where electronically excited states typically are anti-
trapped by an optical lattice, here both ground and excited
rotational states are trapped by an essentially identical po-
tential. Hence motional decoherence due to spin dependent
dipole-dipole forces is strongly suppressed by the large vibra-
tional energy h Second, scattering rates are drastically
reduced. The decay rate at room temperature from excited ro-
tational states is ~ 10-3 Hz [14] versus a comparable rate of
MHz for excited electronic states.

The ground subspace of each molecule is isomorphic to a
spin 1/2 particle. Our goal is to obtain an effective spin-spin
interaction between two neighboring molecules. Static spin-
spin interactions due to spin-rotation and dipole-dipole cou-
plings do exist but are very small in our model: Hvdw(r) =
-(d²/2Br6) [1 + (y/4B)² (1 + 4S1-S2/3 – 255)]. The first
term is the familiar van der Waals 1/r6 interaction, while
the spin dependent piece is strongly suppressed as y/4B ≈
10-3 <1. Therefore, we propose dynamical mixing with
dipole-dipole coupled excited states using a microwave field.

Hamiltonians, spin-dependent lattices or local addressability.
Thus polar molecules in optical lattices are a good candidate
to provide a laboratory realization of exotic states of matter.

molecules depends both on the frequency OF and polarization
ef = a-ê−1 + aoêo+a+ê1, (êo = 2) of the field. The explicit
form for the coupling coefficients is:
