[HEAD]Data Communication (IE30006) > Q1: Signal Approximation > Q1(a) Derivation of Optimum Approximation Coefficient[/HEAD]
Q1. (a) Consider the problem of approximating a real signal g(t) in terms of another real
signal x(t) over an interval \([t_1, t_2]\):
\[g(t) = cx(t) \quad t_1 \le t \le t_2\]
Derive the expression for the optimum value of c for best approximation of g(t) with x(t).

[HEAD]Data Communication (IE30006) > Q3: Signal Bandwidth and Autocorrelation > Q3(b) Autocorrelation of Random Binary Pulse Train[/HEAD]
(b) The figure above shows a random binary pulse train g(t). The pulse width is \(T_b/2\) and
one binary digit is transmitted every \(T_b\) seconds. A binary 1 is transmitted by the positive pulse
and a binary 0 is transmitted by the negative pulse. The two symbols are equally likely and
occur randomly. Determine the auto-correlation function. (Assume that N pulses occur in the
averaging interval T.)
