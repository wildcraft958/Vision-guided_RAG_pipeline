# Sample PDFs

Place your PDF files in this directory to test the chunking pipeline.

## Recommended Document Types

The vision-guided chunking approach works best with:

- **Technical manuals** with procedures and tables
- **Research papers** with figures and references  
- **Business reports** with mixed content types
- **Regulatory documents** with structured sections
- **Educational materials** with step-by-step content

## Example Documents

You can test with various document types:

1. **Simple text documents** - to see basic chunking
2. **Documents with tables** - to test table preservation
3. **Multi-page procedures** - to test step continuity
4. **Mixed content documents** - to test content type detection

## Results

After processing, you'll get:
- Structured chunks with hierarchical headings
- Preserved table and list structures
- Context-aware chunk boundaries
- Metadata about content types
- Processing statistics and analysis
