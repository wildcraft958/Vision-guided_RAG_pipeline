[HEAD]A toolbox for lattice spin models with polar molecules > I. INTRODUCTION > Introduction to Lattice Spin Models[/HEAD]
Lattice spin models are ubiquitous in condensed matter
physics where they are used as simplified models to describe
the characteristic behavior of more complicated interacting
physical systems. Recently there have been exciting theoret-
ical discoveries of models with quasi-local spin interactions
with emergent topological order [1, 2]. In contrast to Landau
theory where various phases of matter are described by bro-
ken symmetries, topological ordered states are distinguished
by homology class and have the property of being robust to
arbitrary perturbations of the underlying Hamiltonian. These
states do not exhibit long range order in pairwise operators,
rather they have long range order in highly nonlocal strings
of operators. A real world example is the fractional quantum
Hall effect which gives rise to states with the same symmetry
but distinguishable by quantum numbers associated with the
topology of the surface they live on [3].
It is of significant interest to “design” materials with these
properties, both to observe and study exotic phases, and in
light of possible applications. Cold atomic and molecular
gases in optical lattices are prime candidates for this endeavor
in view of the complete controllability of these systems in
the laboratory. The idea of realizing bosonic and fermionic
Hubbard models, and thus also lattice spin models, with cold
atoms in optical lattices has sparked a remarkable series of
experiments, and has triggered numerous theoretical studies
to develop cold atoms as a quantum simulator for strongly
correlated condensed matter systems (see e.g. [4, 5, 6] and
references therein). However, coaxing a physical system to
mimic the required interactions for relevant lattice spin mod-
els, which must be both anisotropic in space and in the spin de-
grees of freedom, and given range, is highly nontrivial. Here
we show that cold gases of polar molecules, as presently de-
veloped in the laboratory [7], allow us to construct in a natural
way a complete toolbox for any permutation symmetric two
spin-1/2 (qubit) interaction. The attractiveness of this idea
also rests on the fact that dipolar interactions have coupling
strengths significantly larger than those of the atomic Hubbard
models, and relevant decoherence rates.
Our basic building block is a system of two polar molecules
strongly trapped a given sites of an optical lattice, where the
spin-1/2 (or qubit) is represented by a single electron out-
side a closed shell of a heteronuclear molecule in its rotational
ground state. Heteronuclear molecules have large permanent
electric dipole moments. This implies that the rotational mo-
tion of molecules is coupled strongly via the dipole-dipole in-
teractions, whose signatures are the long range 1/r³ character
and an angular dependence, where the polar molecules attract
or repel each other depending on the relative orientation of
their dipole moments. In addition, microwave excitation of
rotational energy levels allows to effectively tailor the spatial
dependence of dipole-dipole interactions. Finally, account-
ing for the spin-rotation splitting of molecular rotational levels
we can make these dipole-dipole interactions spin-dependent.
General lattice spin models are readily built from these binary
interactions.

This model has the same spin dependence and nearest neigh-
bor graph as the model on a honeycomb lattice introduced by
Kitaev [9]. He has shown that by tuning the ratio of interac-
tion strengths |J₁|/|Jz| one can tune the system from a gapped
phase carrying Abelian anyonic excitations to a gapless phase
which in the presence of a magnetic field becomes gapped
with non-Abelian excitations. In the regime |J₁|/|Jz| < 1 the
Hamilonian can be mapped to a model with four body oper-
ators on a square lattice with ground states that encode topo-
logically protected quantum memory [10]. One proposal [11]
describes how to use trapped atoms in spin dependent optical
lattices to simulate the spin model H(II). There the induced
spin couplings are obtained via spin dependent collisions in
second order tunneling processes. Larger coupling strengths
are desirable. In both spin models (I and II) above, the signs
of the interactions are irrelevant although we will be able to
tune the signs if needed.

Our system is comprised of heteronuclear molecules with
221/2 ground electronic states, corresponding for example to
alkaline-earth monohalogenides with a single electron outside
a closed shell. We adopt a model molecule where the ro-
tational excitations are described by the Hamiltonian Hm =
BN2 + YN S with N the dimensionless orbital angular mo-
mentum of the nuclei, and S the dimensionless electronic spin
(assumed to be S = 1/2 in the following). Here B denotes
the rotational constant and y is the spin-rotation coupling con-
stant, where a typical B is a few tens of GHz, and y in the
hundred MHz regime. The coupled basis of a single molecule
i corresponding to the eigenbasis of Him is {|Ni, Si,Ji; MJ;}}
where J₁ = Ni + Si with eigenvalues E(N = 0,1/2,1/2) =
0,E(1,1/2,1/2) = 2B – γ, and E(1,1/2,3/2) = 2Β + γ/2.
While we ignore hyperfine interactions in the present work,
our discussion below is readily extended to include hyperfine
effects, which offer extensions to spin systems S > 1/2.

The Hamiltonian describing the internal and external dy-
namics of a pair of molecules trapped in wells of an optical
lattice is denoted by H = Hin+Hex. The interaction describing
the internal degrees of freedom is Hin = Hdd + Σ²=1 Him. Here
Hdd is the dipole-dipole interaction given below in Eq. (3).
The Hamiltonian describing the external, or motional, degrees
of freedom is Hex = Σ²=1P}/(2m) + Vi(xi – xī), where Pį is
the momentum of molecule i with mass m, and the potential
generated by the optical lattice V₁(x – x) describes an exter-
nal confinement of molecule i about a local minimum x₁ with
1D rms width zo. We assume isotropic traps that are approx-
imately harmonic near the trap minimum with a vibrational
spacing hoosc. Furthermore, we assume that the molecules
can be prepared in the motional ground state of each local
potential using dissipative electromagnetic pumping [12]. It
is convenient to define the quantization axis ĉ along the axis
connecting the two molecules, x2 – X₁ = Azź with Az corre-
sponding to a multiple of the lattice spacing.
The near field dipole-dipole interaction between two
molecules separated by r = x1 - X2 is

The dipole operator coupling the ground and first rotational
states of molecule i is D = ∑q=−1|N = 1,q)ii(N = 0,0|ê,
and d is the dimensionful dipole moment.
While the present situation of dipole-dipole coupling of ro-
tationally excited polar molecules is reminiscent of the dipole-
dipole interaction of between electronically excited atom pairs
[13], there are important differences. First, unlike the atomic
case where electronically excited states typically are anti-
trapped by an optical lattice, here both ground and excited
rotational states are trapped by an essentially identical po-
tential. Hence motional decoherence due to spin dependent
dipole-dipole forces is strongly suppressed by the large vibra-
tional energy hω Second, scattering rates are drastically
reduced. The decay rate at room temperature from excited ro-
tational states is ~ 10-3 Hz [14] versus a comparable rate of
MHz for excited electronic states.

The ground subspace of each molecule is isomorphic to a
spin 1/2 particle. Our goal is to obtain an effective spin-spin
interaction between two neighboring molecules. Static spin-
spin interactions due to spin-rotation and dipole-dipole cou-
plings do exist but are very small in our model: Hvdw(r) =
-(d4/2Br6) [1 + (y/4B)² (1 + 4S1-S2/3 – 255)]. The first
term is the familiar van der Waals 1/r6 interaction, while
the spin dependent piece is strongly suppressed as y/4B ≈
10-3 <1. Therefore, we propose dynamical mixing with
dipole-dipole coupled excited states using a microwave field.

The molecules are assumed trapped with a separation
Az ~ ry = (2d2/γ)1/3, where the dipole dipole interaction is
d²/r = y/2. In this regime the rotation of the molecules is
strongly coupled to the spin and the excited states are de-
scribed by Hunds case (c) states in analogy to the dipole-
dipole coupled excited electronic states of two atoms with
fine-structure. The ground states are essentially spin indepen-
dent. In the subspace of one rotational quantum (N₁ + N2 = 1),
there are 24 eigenstates of Hin which are linear superpositions
of two electron spin states and properly symmetrized rota-
tional states of the two molecules. There are several sym-
metries that reduce Hin to block diagonal form. First, Hdd,
conserves the quantum number Y = MN + Ms where MN =
MN1 + MN2 and Ms = Ms₁ + Ms₂ are the total rotational and
spin projections along the intermolecular axis. Second, par-ity, defined as the interchange of the two molecules followed
by parity though the center of each molecule, is conserved.
The σ = ±1 eigenvalues of parity are conventionally denoted
g(u) for gerade(ungerade). Finally, there is a symmetry as-sociated with reflection R of all electronic and rotational co-
ordinates through a plane containing the intermolecular axis.
For |Y| > 0 all eigenstates are even under R but for states with
zero angular momentum projection there are ±1 eigenstates of
R. The 16 distinct eigenvalues correspond to degenerate sub-spaces labeled |Y|(J) with J indicating the quantum number
in the r → ∞ asymptotic manifold (N = 0, J = 1/2;N = 1,J).
Remarkably, the eigenvalues and eigenstates can be comput-ing analytically yielding the well known Movre-Pichler po-tentials [15] plotted in Fig. 2.

The authors of Ref. [8] show that the ideal spin model

which is gapped with weak size dependence for cosζ = 1.
The the two ground-states, which we denote, |0) and 1)L,
have zero local magnetizations (6)L. Our implementation is
not ideal because there are residual longer range interactions
along several directions in the plane as well as off resonant
couplings to excited state potentials yielding unwanted spin
patterns. We note, however, that all the effective spin Hamil-tonians described in Eq. (5) obtained using fields with linear
polarization involve sums of products of Pauli operators and
hence are invariant under time-reversal. For l odd, the degen-eracy present in the ground state of HD is of Kramers' type
and imperfect implementation will not break this degeneracy
though it may decrease the energy gap.

Spin model II is likewise obtained using this mechanism.
Consider a system of four molecules connected by three
length b edges forming an orthogonal triad in space. There
are several different microwave field configurations that can
be used to realize the interaction HⅢ) along the links. One
choice is to use two microwave fields polarized along 2,
one tuned near resonance with a 1g potential and one near
a lu potential. When the detunings and Rabi frequencies
are chosen so that 〈|1g|C(1g,3,3) – |№1₄|C(1u,1,1)〉rel =
0 then the resultant spin pattern is Eq. (2) with J₁ =
-<|21|C(18,3,3))rel/4 and J₁ = |<|Ω1g|C(1g,2,2)〉rel/4.
The ratio J₁|/|Jz| can be tuned either by changing the lat-tice spacing or by using a third microwave field polarized
along 2 and tuned near the 2g potential, in which case J₁ →
J₁+<|22|C(2g))rel/8. A bipartite lattice composed of such
triads with equally spaced nearest neighbors can be built using
two planes of stacked triangular lattices. Such a lattice could
be designed using bichromatic trapping lasers in two spatial
dimensions and a suitably modulated lattice in the third di-mension normal to both planes. A realization of model II us-ing a different set of 3 microwave fields is shown in Fig. 4.
The obtained interaction is close to ideal with small residual
coupling to next nearest neighbors as in model I.

We have shown how to engineer pairwise spin-1/2 (or qubit)
interactions between polar molecules with designable range
and spatial anisotropy. The couplings are strong relative to
decoherence rates, and the simulation does not require com-plicated control sequences to build effective time averaged
Hamiltonians, spin-dependent lattices or local addressability.
Thus polar molecules in optical lattices are a good candidate
to provide a laboratory realization of exotic states of matter.

APPENDIX A: EFFECTIVE INTERACTIONS
The effective spin-spin interaction Eq. (5) between polar
molecules depends both on the frequency OF and polarization
ef = a-ê−1 + aoêo+a+ê1, (êo = 2) of the field. The explicit
form for the coupling coefficients is:
A1,1 = |ao|2[C(0,1,2) −C(0,1,2)]
-
+(|α-12+ |α+12) [C(18,3,3) – C(1,1,1)]
+R[αα-][C(0,2,1) – C(0,2,1)],
-
A2,2 = A1,1 −2R[aa-][C(0,2,1) – C(0,2,1)],
A3,3 = |ao|2[2C(18,2,2) – C(0,1,2) – C(0,1,2)]
+(|α+12+|α-12) [C(2g) + C(0,2,1)/2
+C(0,2,1)/2 – C(1, 1, 1) – C(18,3,3)],
A1,2 = I[αα-](C(0,2,1) – C(0+,2,1)),
A1,3 = R[αα – αΐα-]C(1g,2,3),
-
A2,3 = I[α¥¤‰ – αΐα-]C(1,2,3),
A0,1 = R[ααο +αΐα-]C(1g,2,3),
A0,2 = I[ααο + αΐα-]C(1g,2,3),
Α0,3 = (|α+12 – α_|²)[C(2g) - C(0+,2,1)/2
-C(0,2,1)/2].
The component A0,0 weights a scalar energy shift which we
ignore. The coefficients C(|Y|≡) quantify coupling to excited
states with different symmetries and are given by
C(0,j,k) = Kj(0)²s(0(3/2)) + K₁(0)²s(0(1/2)),
C(16,j,k) = Σ=1K(a10(3/2))K(a16(3/2))s(a16(3/2))
C(2g)
+ Σ=1(16(1/2))K(16(1/2))s(16(1/2))
= $(2g(3/2)).

Here the energy dependent terms s(|Y|(J)) = ||/[hωF
E(|Y|(J))] quantify the amplitude in the excited states.
The energies E(|Y|吉(J))) correspond to eigenvalues of Hint
and the sets {Kj(0(J))}}=1 and {K}(º16(J))}}}=1 are co-efficients of the eigenvectors for Y = 0,1. For Y =
0, the energies are E(0+(1+1/2)) = 2B + γ[σ3d2/2γr3
1/4° √(σd2/2yr3 +1/4)2 + 1/2], and E(0-(1±1/2)) =
2B + γ[ − σd² /2yr3 – 1/4± √(−63d2/2yr3 + 1/4)2 + 1/2],
The eigenvector components are K₁(0) = cos(yom/2) and
K2(0) = sin(yo/2) where the angles_satisfy tan(Yo+) =
√2/(1/2+od²/γr³), and tan(Yo-) = √2/(1/2 – 63d2/yr³).
For Y = ±1 the eigenvectors and doubly degenerate eigenval-ues are obtained by diagonalizing the 3 × 3 matrices:

For Y = ±2, the eigenvalues are doubly degenerate with ener-gies E(2(3/2)) = 2B + γ/2+ σd²/r3.

[HEAD]A toolbox for lattice spin models with polar molecules > APPENDIX A: EFFECTIVE INTERACTIONS > Finite Size Effects and Wavepacket Localization[/HEAD]
A caveat is that we do not have point dipoles but rather
wavepackets with spatial distributions parallel and perpen-dicular to the intermolecular axis 2. Components of inter-molecular separations orthogonal to 2 will couple to states
with different symmetry and an exact treatment would re-quire averaging over the angular distrubution with the ap-propriate frame transformation. However, we argue that in
our regime this finite size affect is negligible. The relative
magnitude can be estimated by the ratio of the marginal rel-ative coordinate probability distributions perpendicular and
parallel to 2. Defining p₁(r) = [ dosin² Or² |¥rel (r, 0)|2 and
p\\ (r) = fd2cos² Or2|Ψrel(r, 0)|2, the peak of the distribu-tions is at r = Az where for zo/Az < 1, the relative amount
of unwanted couplings is p₁(∆z)/p\\(Az) ~ 4(zo/Az)2. For
molecular wavepacket localization 2πzo/2trap = 0.1, the ratio
is p₁(trap)/P(trap) ≈ 10–3, hence it is warranted to com-pute the couplings as if the entire weight of the wavefunction
were parallel to 2.
